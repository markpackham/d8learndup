Please put either this (no injection used in the first one):

$our_service = \Drupal::service('drupalup_service.cow');
kint($our_service->saySomething());die();


Or this in Devel's /devel/php section with Devel Kint enabled to execute:

$our_service = \Drupal::service('drupalup_service.cow');
kint($our_service->whoIsYourOwner());die();
